\f0\fs24 \cf0 Three populations - Tp, t+, t-\
Resistance/independence/producing has a constant cost that translates directly into reproduction rates.\
Cancer cells share the same resources.\
Drugs hit all t+ cell populations as an aggregate (no accounting for spatial diffusion into tumor balls) and no other populations\
I made up some half-assed starting cell count\
Natural growth is gompertz - carrying capacity is shared across cells, so total cell number determines that crap.\
\
Drugs:\
After drugs administered, their concentration linearly declines, and is directly proportional to impact on cancer and independent on number of cells impacted.\
\
Immune system continuously, constantly(regardless of cell number) and independently acts regardless of drug concentration to reduce proliferation rates.\
\
Our goal is to hold the change in cell population constant indefinitely. This prob means to kill to hold constant t-.\
\
The model is not stochastic?\
\
testosterone production varies directly with tP and has linear effect on tM}
